## Week 4

Tuesday we discussed analyzing and evaluating data visualizations.

On Thursday we learned how to create a line chart, area chart, and multiline chart using D3.

For the homework, I used what I learned from class to create a line chart visualizing the
interest rate in 2020 for Canada. The files can be found in homework.html and homework.js.
The URL for this chart is found <a href="https://davidyxwu.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_04/homework.html">here</a>.
