## Week 4

Tuesday we discussed storytelling through data visualization. We had many readings and videos explaining story telling technique through data, shifting the focus of our data visualization from ourselves towards the audience.

On Thursday we learned how to create a line chart, area chart, and multiline chart using D3.

For the homework, I used what I learned from class to create a line chart visualizing the
interest rate in 2020 for Canada. The files can be found in homework.html and homework.js.
The URL for this chart is found <a href="https://davidyxwu.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_04/homework.html">here</a>.
