# Week 2: Finding Data for the Final Project

## Overview
For my final project, I am interested in creating data visualizations about certain statistics about the National Hockey League (NHL) :ice_hockey:. 

## Data Source
I will be using the official NHL stats api and records API that the NHL provides. 
The stats API can be accessed by a GET request using the URL 
`https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1`
with various endpoints. The records API can be accessed by a GET request using the URL
`https://records.nhl.com/site/api`. The API is well documented [here](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/tree/master/).

## Concerns about the data

## Other secondary sources
This data is primary, as it comes from the official NHL organization and provides a lot of information from game logs to individual player information. 
Some secondary data I could use include more organized data from sources such as [Money Puck](https://moneypuck.com/data.htm).
