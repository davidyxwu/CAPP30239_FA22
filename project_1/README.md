# Project 1: Dear Data

For my Dear Data postcard, I wanted to track me and my friends' emoji usage, and how much the emojis I sent vs. received differed.
I also wanted to track which platforms I was sending/receiving these emojis, and whether the emojis were used in positive, negative, and/or neutral messages.
