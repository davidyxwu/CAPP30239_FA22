## Week 3

Tuesday we discussed three data visualization theorists: Stephen Few, Edward Tufte, and Alberto Cairo.

On Thursday we learned how to create a simple barchart using D3.

<a href="covid.csv">COVID Data</a> comes from the <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University</a> and Open Data from New York Times. The barchart is found in index.html and script.js. 
The URL for this chart is found <a href="https://davidyxwu.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_03/">here</a>.

For the homework, I used what I learned from class to create a bar chart visualizing the
number of visits for each library branch. The files can be found in homework.html and homework.js.
The URL for this chart is found <a href="https://davidyxwu.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_03/homework.html">here</a>.


<a href="library_visits_jan22.csv">Library visits data</a> comes from the Chicago Data Portal.
