        <h1>Colorado Avalanche 2021-2022 Regular Season</h1>
        <p>
            In the 2021-2022 NHL season, the Colorado Avalanche won their third Stanley Cup in franchise history.
            The Avs finished atop the Western Conference and second in the league with 119 points, setting a
            franchise record. They also had the fifth-longest home-ice winning streak in NHL history with 18
            games—making for a thrilling ride in both the regular season and the playoffs.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the keys to the Avs success was their high-powered offense. While superstar Nathan MacKinnon and
            Norris Trophy Winner (Top Defenseman) Cale Makar stole headlines, the Avs offense was well distributed
            with eight different players having 50+ point (goals + assists) seasons and four having 80+ point
            seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this article, we will give context to the Avs historic 2021-2022 regular season and then examine
            their offensive statistics compared to the league to understand how they dominated.

                The Avalanche finished with a 56-19-7 (Win-Loss-Shootout Loss) record with 119 points. Overall, they
                finished with an average goal differential of 0.93 difference per game—meaning on average, the Avs
                finished almost 1 goal ahead of the other team. Their largest margin of victory was 6 goals, which they
                achieved 3 times, and their largest margin of defeat was 5 goals, happening only once. Further, they had
                many large winning streaks, for example, games 67-75.
